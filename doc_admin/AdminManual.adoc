== Open Hospital

== 1 Introduction

OH - Open Hospital (https://www.open-hospital.org/) is a free and open-source Electronic Health Record (EHR) software application.
Open Hospital is deployed as a desktop application that can be used in a standalone, single-user mode (PORTABLE mode)
or in a client/server network configuration (CLIENT mode), where multiple clients and users connect to the same database server.

Open Hospital is developed in Java and it is based on open-source tools and libraries; it runs on any computer, requires low resources, and is designed to work without an internet connection.

Open Hospital is the first of a set of software applications that ISFfootnote:[Informatici Senza Frontiere - https://www.informaticisenzafrontiere.org] has developed to support the information management and the activities of hospitals and health centers in the simplest manner possible, by providing tools for the administrative operations (like registering patients, manage laboratory analysis and pharmaceutical stocks) and to produce detailed statistics and reports.
It was first deployed in 2006 at the St. Luke Hospital in Angal (Uganda) and it is now used in dozens of different locations around the world.

== 2 Installation

=== 2.1 OH - CLIENT mode

Open Hospital is a client application that can be used on a single computer (PORTABLE mode) or in a client/server configuration (CLIENT mode). The server part utilizes a DBMSfootnote:[DataBase Management System] to archive, share, and present the information. The free and open-source MariaDBfootnote:[See https://www.mariadb.org] is the preferred database server.

The typical client/server, networked (LAN) configuration is shown in the following figure:

image:image3.png[image,width=642,height=243]

The Administrator/Installer tasks are hereby listed:

* <<download,Download>> the Open Hospital package for the selected Operating System
* <<setup,Setup>> the downloaded OH package by uncompressing the archive in a folder of your choice
* <<jre,Install JAVA JRE>> - Java Runtime Environment (see compatibility matrix for the right version) on every client
* <<database-server,Install and configure MariaDB/MySQL>> on the server/computer that will act as the OH database server
* <<ohdatabase-creation,Create the OH database>> through the execution of a script found in the _sql/_ folder
* Copy the Open Hospital application on every client (it may also be installed on the server)
* <<configuration,Configure>> each Open Hospital instance to point to the OH database server (using the hostname or the IP address)

==== 2.1.1 Prerequisites - Software compatibility matrix

Before starting, check the following software compatibility matrix, to verify the external software versions needed to run Open Hospital and the current available extended features for every version, architecture, and operating system.
include::./OH_software_compatibility_matrix.adoc[]


[#jre]
==== 2.1.2 Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

Depending on the operating system, there are different ways to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
The **oh.sh / oh.bat** scripts can be used to download and install the latest JRE available; it is also possible to install it
manually, following the specific instructions for the operating system being used.

NOTE: See Software Compatibility Matrix to identify the correct Java version.

[#database-server]
==== 2.1.3 Database Server

Depending on the operating system, there are several software tools to install and manage a MariaDB/MySQL database server. In most cases just a standard installation package of the software is needed, paying attention to configuration options during the installation process.

NOTE: See Software Compatibility Matrix to identify the correct MariaDB / MySQL version.

NOTE: MariaDB is the preferred alternative for the DBMS.


===== 2.1.3.1 MariaDB/MySQL - Server installation

Please referer to the latest MariaDB/MySQL Server online documentation for downloadfootnote:[https://mariadb.org/download/] and installationfootnote:[https://mariadb.org/documentation/] information while using this document.

*on a Linux machine*: during the installation, a “root” password must be defined; it is very important to choose it carefully and to keep it safe.

*on a Windows machine*: launch the installation and pay attention to the following steps:

• Custom Setup
• Install all components except Development Components
• Select Modify password for database user 'root', choose the root password, and keep it safe
• Select Enable access from remote machines for 'root' user
• Select UTF8 as the default charset for Best Support For Multilingualism
• Select Install as service
• Select Enable networking and take note of the selected Port Number

NOTE: MariaDB installer does not include the bin directory in the Windows PATH environment variable; it must be added manually to the Windows system variable PATH.

To check if the server is active and running, open a terminal window (command prompt) and type the following command:

*# mysql –u root -p*

*Enter password: *****

The terminal should reply with the MySQL client command line prompt:

*mysql>*

The prompt means that a successful connection to the database server instance has been established.

NOTE: If the terminal does not reply as above most probably during installation the *Include Bin Directory in Windows PATH* option was not selected and therefore Windows can not find the mysql command. If this is the case add the path manually by searching "system variables" in the Control Panel or append the full path to the "mysql" command (e.g., "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0\bin\mysql" [with the quotes]). Another option is to uninstall and reinstall MySQL with the *Include* option selected.


===== 2.1.3.2 MariaDB/MySQL - Configuration

Please use the following configuration values for MariaDB/MySQL server in _my.cnf_ config file. Values can be adjusted and adapted to the hardware resources available.
Config file can be _my.ini_ or _my.cnf_; default for Windows MariaDB is _my.ini_ located at "C:\Program Files\MariaDB-[VERSION]\data\"

----
#
# Configuration to be inserted below last row of [mysqld] section
#
sql_mode=STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION
max_allowed_packet = 4M # must be adjusted with the value used on clients for DICOM_SIZE
skip-external-locking
key_buffer_size = 16M
thread_cache_size = 64
lower_case_table_names = 1
table_open_cache = 64
tmp_table_size = 16M
read_buffer_size = 256K
read_rnd_buffer_size = 512K
join_buffer_size = 2M
sort_buffer_size = 2M
myisam_sort_buffer_size = 8M

[mysqldump]
quick
max_allowed_packet = 16M

[mysql]
no-auto-rehash

[isamchk]
key_buffer = 16M
sort_buffer_size = 16M
read_buffer = 2M
write_buffer = 2M

[myisamchk]
key_buffer = 16M
sort_buffer_size = 16M
read_buffer = 2M
write_buffer = 2M
----

===== 2.1.3.3 MariaDB/MySQL - Networking

If deployed in a client-server, networked configuration, the database server must be configured to listen on the network interface connected to the local LAN; this can be achieved by editing the MariaDB/MySQL's config file, _my.cnf_, and setting the "bind-address" parameter. For example, if you want the database server to listen on all the available network interfaces / IP addresses:

Change:

[source,properties]
----
# Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.
bind-address = 127.0.0.1
----

To:

[source,properties]
----
# Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.
bind-address = 0.0.0.0
----

In this way, the database server listens on any IP address (0.0.0.0) configured on the server and can serve the connecting clients.

In is also possible to specify a specific IP address, e.g:
----
bind-address = 192.168.1.100
----

[#ohdatabase-creation]
==== 2.1.4 OH - Database creation

To create the Open Hospital database, a MySQL client and a set of SQL script files found under the _sql/_ folder are needed.

On a Microsoft Windows® system, MySQL Workbench® can be used as a client to connect to the database server and perform the needed tasks, while on Linux based systems the MySQL Administrator and MySQL Query Browser tools can be used.

The suggested approach is to use the command-line MariaDB/MySQL client which uses the same commands and syntax for every platform.

Open a terminal and navigate to the _sql/_ folder (e.g.):

[source,shell]
----
C:\WINDOWS> cd C:\Users\OH\OpenHospital-v1.11.1\sql

C:\Users\OH\OpenHospital-v1.11.1\sql

----

and run the following command to connect to the database server (e.g.):

[source,shell]
----
C:\Users\OH\OpenHospital-v1.11.1\sql> mysql -u root -p [-h hostname/ip address]
Enter password: *****
----

using the ‘root’ password chosen during the installation process. The terminal should reply with the MySQL client command line prompt:

[source,shell]
----
mysql>
----

now we are ready to create the database user (isf) with password, the main OH database and grant the necessary permissions with the following SQL commands:

[source,shell]
----
mysql>  CREATE DATABASE oh; CREATE USER 'isf'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'isf123';
        CREATE USER 'isf'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'isf123'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON oh.* TO 'isf'@'localhost'; \
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON oh.* TO 'isf'@'%';
mysql>  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

----

To check if the database has been correctly created, enter the following command:

[source,shell]
----
mysql> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| oh                 |
| performance_schema |
+--------------------+
----
The next step is to launch the main SQL database creation script with the command:

[source,shell]
----
mysql> source create_all_en.sql
----

NOTE: The data can be installed in different languages by using the related "create_all_xx.sql" file or with demo data using the "create_all_demo.sql" file (English only).

NOTE: If the error message "ERROR 1148 (42000): The used command is not allowed with this MySQL version" appears the "local infile" command must be enabled on the
client by logging in again and specifying the "--local-infile=1" parameter after the "-p"; thus "mysql -u root -p --local-infile=1".

The SQL script creates the OH database structure and populates it with default data.

The ‘isf’ user, different from the ‘root’ one, is the user that the Open Hospital software uses to connect to the database and its password must be changed immediately with the command:

[source,shell]
----
mysql>SET PASSWORD FOR isf'@'%' = PASSWORD('new-password-here');

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

Rows matched: 1 Changed: 1 Warnings: 0
----

And then:

[source,shell]
----
mysql>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
----

[source,shell]
----
mysql>quit;
----

NOTE: Remember to set the updated database password also in the Open Hospital configuration files and startup scripts **oh.sh / oh.ps1**.

==== 2.1.5 OH - Database configuration

To set up the database connection for Open Hospital, edit and configure the database settings in the **oh.sh / oh.ps1** startup scripts or directly modify the _database.properties_ and _log4j.properties_ configuration files, located in the _oh/rsc/_ resource folder.

Specify, according to the values specified in the installation phase:

* the *IP address* of the the MariaDB/MySQL database server hosting the the Open Hospital database. Replace “localhost” with the server IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
* the *TCP Port Number* of the database server - default is “3306"
* the *Database name* of the OH installation - default is "oh"
* the *Database user* of the OH database - default is "isf"
* the *Database password* associated with the user

NOTE: These settings are required for every Open Hospital installation/client.

More information on these files can be found in the sections <<database-properties,database.properties>> and
<<log4j-properties,log4j.properties>>.

NOTE: It is possible to use the provided scripts to generate the config files: on Linux execute *oh.sh -g*, on Windows launch *oh.bat* and choose the option *g*.

==== 2.1.6 OH - Startup and run

The Open Hospital software is now ready to be run by executing the proper launcher command:

* on a Linux machine: *oh.sh -C* (CLIENT mode)
* on a Windows machine: *oh.bat* (Select CLIENT mode from the interactive menu)

If everything is configured correctly, the Open Hospital main splash screen is presented:

image:OH-splash.png[OH-splash.png,width=316,height=237]

And then the main Menu:

image:OH-main_menu.png[OH main menu]

It is possible to create a shortcut (link) to the executable script on the desktop, in the Programs Menu or wherever is useful by using the provided icon “oh.ico” that is found in the package.

image:image100.png[oh.ico,width=32,height=32]

NOTE: Remember to review your setup in the Open Hospital configuration files and startup scripts **oh.sh / oh.ps1**.

=== 2.2 OH - PORTABLE mode

Open Hospital is a Java software program and it is portable by definition. The *PORTABLE* mode described in this chapter refers to the possibility of using OH as a self contained package that includes Java, MariaDB/MySQL Server and all the data, without requiring any software installation. The package can be used on a single computer and used everywhere just by copying a folder - even onto an USB stick - carrying together all the saved data.

Pre-configured "Portable" packages are available for Windows and Linux; see the <<download,Download>> section for more details.

Since the JRE and MariaDB/MySQL are not platform-independent and are provided in different versions and architectures, there exists:

* *Open Hospital - portable for Linux* platforms (embedding Java JRE and MariaDB for Linux, 32 or 64bit)
* *Open Hospital - portable for Windows* platforms (embedding Java JRE and MariaDB for Windows, 32 or 64bit)

Once the required version is downloaded, the application can be started by launching the script inside the package:

* *oh.sh* in the Linux version
* *oh.bat* in the Windows version

No other configuration is needed. Additional options can be shown by executing:

* on Linux: *oh.sh -h*
* on Windows: *oh.bat* and choose among the available options. See *oh.bat -h* for legacymode help.

NOTE: To use Open Hospital in PORTABLE mode for Linux from a USB key it is required that the file permissions in the
archive remain unchanged once extracted, otherwise the launcher cannot launch or use the application in an appropriate manner.

NOTE: Important: the PORTABLE mode is meant to try or test the software or to be used in a facility (like a dispensary)
where only a single computer is available. If the facility is large and more clients/operators need to work on the same data, the full installation (client/server) in a networked architecture is recommended.

These folders may be organized differently depending on the version of the software or the architecture of the operating system.

Depending on the chosen operating system and architecture, the needed external applications and libraries (like MySQL/MariaDB and Java JRE) will be present also:

** _zulu8.58.0.13-ca-fx-jdk8.0.312-<operating_system>_<arch>/ - Java Virtual Machine
** _mariadb-<version>-<arch>/ or _mysql-<version>-<arch>-<build>/_ - MySQL Server or MariaDB Server

<<<

[#configuration]
== 3 Configuration

Configuration of the local Open Hospital instance (CLIENT and PORTABLE mode) is set in the configuration files called “properties files”. The following properties files are found in the **oh/rsc** subfolder:

** *database.properties* – Open Hospital database connection
** *dicom.properties* – DICOM viewer module options
** *examination.properties* – contains the settings for the ‘examination’ module
** *log4j.properties* – Logging system and paths
** *settings.properties* – Open Hospital options and settings
** *sms.properties* – SMS Manager module
** *txtPrinter.properties* – Text printing system
** *xmpp.properties* – Xmpp Server configuration

Furthermore, additional configurations files (not meant to be modified by the user) are:

* *resolutions.xml* –  stores locally the information about webcams
* *version.properties* – contains the current Open Hospital version

The properties files are related only to the local instance of Open Hospital; different instances may use specific OH configuration with custom properties files.
The properties files can be generated automatically from the packaged _.dist_ files by editing the configuration options available in the startup scripts **oh.sh / oh.ps1** and launching OH. The properties files can also be modified manually using a text editor.

NOTE: Any change to these files requires an application restart to apply the modified settings.

NOTE: The properties files are automatically generated/overwritten at any Open Hospital startup, unless MANUAL_CONFIG option is set to "on" in the **oh.sh / oh.ps1** scripts.

The following chapters will describe these properties files and their features in detail.

[#settings-properties]
=== 3.1 settings.properties

Open Hospital general configuration is set in the _settings.properties_ file.
Default configuration is available in the _settings.properties.dist_ file:

Values can be:

* *Boolean*: yes | no or true | false
* *String*: usually a filename or a country code (ISO 3166-1)

Use the provided startup scripts in order to automatically generate the _settings.properties_ file from the corresponding _.dist_ file, or set manually the KEY/value pair as explained in the following sections.

[#language]
==== 3.1.1 LANGUAGE

The following table shows the allowed values for the OH_LANGUAGE variable:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Key |Default Value | Allowed Values
|LANGUAGE |en |ar, en, it, fr, es, de, sw
|===

Open Hospital is available in nine different languages, identified by the international country code:

* ar – Arabic
* de - German
* en – English
* es – Spanish
* fr – French
* it – Italian
* pt – Portuguese
* sw – Swahili
* zh_CN - simplified Chinese

To change the language used in the application edit _settings.properties_ and change the value of this key.
If an unknown value is set, the local computer language is applied.

NOTE: An application restart is required to apply the modified setting.

NOTE: The OH_LANGUAGE setting is automatically generated/overwritten at any OpenHospital startup, unless MANUAL_CONFIG option is set to "on" in the  **oh.sh / oh.ps1** scripts.

==== 3.1.2 SINGLEUSER

The following table shows the default value and the allowed ones:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Key |Default Value | Allowed Values
|SINGLEUSER |yes |yes, no
|===

Open Hospital is designed to support multi-user usage. This means that is possible to define different users, arrange them by group and set different rights in application usage; for instance, a user “receptionist” may be able to register a new patient but not to prescribe a therapy.

Open Hospital has a predefined user called “admin” that has access rights to all the features of the application.
When SINGLEUSER is set to YES (default) the program starts with this user and all the features are available.

If SINGLEUSER is set to NO the following login window appears when the program is started:

image:image24.png[Login.png,width=305,height=148]

The default password for the “admin” user is “admin”. After typing this password in the white field and pressing *[.underline]##S##ubmit*, the main *_Menu_* with the functions are enabled.

Once logged in as the “admin” user defining additional users and/or groups is possible (see the
link:https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-doc/blob/develop/doc_user/UserManual.adoc#users-groups[Users & Groups] chapter in the User's Guide), or just continue with a simple form of data protection.

NOTE: The setting is client-side specific, this means that the login can be disabled on a specific client, but logons will still
be required on other clients, with the same defined user and group.

WARNING: Data security must never be left solely to the application but it must include proper network architecture and a rigid configuration of the clients.


==== 3.1.3 AUTOMATICLOT

The following table shows the default value and the alternatives for lot management:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Key |Default Value |Valid Values
|AUTOMATICLOT_IN |no |yes, no
|AUTOMATICLOT_OUT |no |yes, no
|AUTOMATICLOTWARD_TOWARD |no |yes, no
|===

Open Hospital allows for automatic management of lots in the main pharmacy.
This means that is possible to work in the pharmacy without taking care of lot definitions in loading the store and
just specify preparation and expiring date for each charging movement
(see link:https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-doc/blob/develop/doc_user/UserManual.adoc#4-2-2-2-insert-stock-charging-movement-charge[4.2.2.2 Insert stock charging movement] in the User's Guide).

For discharging movement, the lot is automatically calculated according to the nearest expiring date of lots (FEFO - First Expiring First Out). If the quantity to discharge is larger than the quantity of the first selected lot, more than one discharging operation can be generated.

_AUTOMATIC LOTS MANAGEMENT_ is split into two different settings for charging and discharging the main pharmacy and to manage lots also in the wards.
In this way, more control is given to the user that may want to provide all the lots' details in _charging operations_ but ask the application to automatically _discharge_ the nearest expiring ones (FEFO).
Similarly, in wards (see link:https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-doc/blob/develop/doc_user/UserManual.adoc#4-3-pharmaceuticals-stock-ward-pharmaceuticals-stock-ward[4.3 Pharmaceuticals Stock Ward] in the User's Guide)
the user may decide to manage lots manually or to ask the application to do it automatically.

With *AUTOMATICLOT_IN = YES* the application generates a lot number automatically and only asks for an expiration date (mandatory). By default, AUTOMATICLOT_IN is set to NO. It is possible to change the value at any time.

With *AUTOMATICLOT_OUT = YES* the application discharges automatically the nearest expiring lot when required. By default, AUTOMATICLOT_OUT is set to NO. It is possible to change the value at any time.

With *AUTOMATICLOTWARD_TOWARD = YES*, the application discharges from a ward (to other wards) the nearest expiring lot automatically when required. By default, AUTOMATICLOTWARD_TOWARD is set to NO. It is possible to change the value at any time.
For discharges to patients (drug giving) the lot is *never* asked.

NOTE: An application restart is required to apply the modified settings.

. Plug the device into the system and make sure the system recognizes it, loads a proper driver for it and assigns a serial port (COM)
. Launch the OH startup script and select the the G option:

 ** On Windows launch **oh.bat** -> select *G* option
 ** On linux launch **oh.sh -G**

. Once the utility has started, it will scan all plugged devices and will try to recognize the modem (or phone) within them
. If the device is recognized as a modem, a confirmation message prompt is shown:

image:image25.png[image,width=293,height=120]
[start=4]
. If the identified device is the correct one, just click “yes”, otherwise click “no”, and the scan will continue

NOTE: The _database.properties_ file is automatically generated/overwritten at any Open Hospital startup, unless MANUAL_CONFIG option is set to "on" in the **oh.sh / oh.ps1** scripts.

=== 3.3 dicom.properties

DICOM configuration is set in the _dicom.properties_ file.
Default DICOM configuration is available in the _dicom.properties.dist_ file:

[source,properties]
----
#dicom.manager.impl=org.isf.dicom.manager.FileSystemDicomManager        # filesystem storage
#dicom.manager.impl=org.isf.dicom.manager.SqlDicomManager               # database storage
#dicom.max.size=1024B, 2048B, 1M, 16M, 256M, 512M, 1024M, 1G            # image size examples
dicom.manager.impl=org.isf.dicom.manager.DICOM_STORAGE
dicom.storage.filesystem=OH_PATH_SUBSTITUTE/DICOM_DIR
dicom.max.size=DICOM_SIZE
----

Use the provided startup scripts in order to automatically generate the _dicom.properties_ file from the corresponding _.dist_ file, or set manually the following parameters:

* *DICOM_STORAGE*: This property accepts one of the following:
** SqlDicomManager: DICOM files are stored in the database
** FileSystemDicomManager: DICOM files are stored in the file system
* *OH_PATH_SUBSTITUTE/DICOM_DIR*: if the value of the first parameter is set to "FileSystemDicomManager",
this property specifies the path where the DICOM files are stored. It is possible to specify a local folder (_data/dicom_storage_ is the default path under the OH installation folder) or to set a shared network folder, useful for LAN - client/server environment. Suggested configuration is to map the network/NFS folder under the _data/dicom_storage_ path with a symbolic link.
The shared folder needs read/write permissions for uploading DICOM images. Always use slash "/" in the path variable and not backslash "\".
* *DICOM_SIZE*: maximum allowed size for a dicom/jpg image (the MariaDB/MySQL server setting max_allowed_packet should be set with the same or a larger value).
If not specified the default value of "4M" is used.

Example _dicom.properties_ file:
[source,properties]
----
dicom.manager.impl=org.isf.dicom.manager.FileSystemDicomManager
dicom.storage.filesystem=Z:/OH/Shared/Dicom_images
dicom.max.size=4M
----

NOTE: The _dicom.properties_ file is automatically generated/overwritten at any **oh.sh / oh.ps1**  startup, unless MANUAL_CONFIG option is set to "on" in the scripts.

[#txtprinter-properties]
===  3.7 txtPrinter.properties

Text printer configuration is set in the _txtPrinter.properties_ file:

[source,properties]
----
# This file contains text printing information
# MODE = TXT, PDF or ZPL
USE_DEFAULT_PRINTER=yes
PRINT_AS_PAID=no
PRINT_WITHOUT_ASK=no
MODE=PDF
#TXT_CHAR_HEIGHT=10
#TXT_CHAR_WIDTH=10
ZPL_FONT_TYPE=0
ZPL_ROW_HEIGHT=25
----

This file is used only if the RECEIPTPRINTER flag is enabled (see <<receiptprinter,RECEIPTPRINTER>> in this document).

The file has the following configurable parameters:

* *USE_DEFAULT_PRINTER*: If it is set to _yes_, Open Hospital will use the default printer, otherwise it will show the system
printing dialog allowing a change to the printer at every print attempt:

image:image42.png[image,width=291,height=245]

* *PRINT_AS_PAID*: This changes the behavior when a Bill is set to PAID in the Accounting module
(see link:https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-doc/blob/develop/doc_user/UserManual.adoc#6-1-2-11-print-receipt-function[6.2.1.11 Print receipt] function in User’s Guide). +
 ** If it is set to _yes_, Open Hospital will try to print a receipt just after a Bill is set to PAID +
 *** A confirmation window will appear (see below), otherwise, it must be done after, by pressing the *[.underline]##E##dit Bill* button on the already closed (“C”) bill

image:image43.png[Accountin_print_as_paid]

* *PRINT_WITHOUT_ASK*: if set to yes Open Hospital will try to print the receipt without the confirmation window
* *MODE*: the MODE can take three values:
** *TXT*: the bill is printed as pure text (no graphics)
** *PDF*: the bill will be printed as a PDF
** *ZPL*: the text printer connected to the system works with ZPL language (an EPL evolution for Zebra Label Printer)
* *ZPL_FONT_TYPE*: a 0 (zero) value stands for a standard character; the value can be changed to “A”, “B”, “C”, etc. according to the device datasheet, to obtain a better look
* *ZPL_FONT_SIZE*: an integer value to adjust the character size to obtain a better look

The best way to set these parameters for the device is to set them one by one and check the different results until the best fit is reached.

NOTE: An application restart is required to apply the modified setting.

[#xmpp-properties]
=== 3.8 xmpp.properties

XMPP module configuration is set in the the _xmpp.properties_ file:

[source,properties]
----
# This file contains Xmpp Server information
DOMAIN=127.0.0.1
PORT=5222
----

This file is used only if the XMPPMODULEENABLED flag is enabled (see <<xmppmoduleenabled,XMPPMODULEENABLED>> in this document).

To use the Communication module
(see link:https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-doc/blob/develop/doc_user/UserManual.adoc#11-communication-communication[11 Communication] in the User’s Guide), 
an XMPP Server must be installed and configured separately on a server/computer in the local network. The XMPP server can also be installed on the same machine as the OH database server.

The most common XMPP Server is the free and open-source project Ignite Openfire® (http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/) available for Linux, Windows, and Mac.

Once the XMPP Server is installed, active and running set the two parameters in the _xmpp.properties_ file as follows:

* *DOMAIN* – the IP address of the XMPP server (it could be the same as the database server)
* *PORT* – 5222 or another if set differently

NOTE: An application restart is required to apply the modified setting.


==== 3.8.1 OpenFire Settings

The XMPP module needs some knowledge about the XMPP protocol and how an XMPP server works.

Every new user login into Open Hospital creates an OpenFire user with the same username and password (even if passwords are saved
differently in OH and OpenFire DB). For this reason, the OH "admin" user may conflict with the OpenFire user, not allowing the log in as admin and to chat.

NOTE: If the admin user needs to chat with other users consider creating another "superuser" in OH
under the "admin" group.

To allow users to see each other and communicate via XMPP protocol, they must belong to the same OpenFire "group" and have the other users in their own "_roster_" (find more comprehensive information about "group" and "roster" in the online documentation).

Please follow these settings:

. Install OpenFire server (better if from the zip file) on a writable path
. Set in both OpenFire and in the _xmpp.properties_ file an IP address rather than the FQDN (e.g., 127.0.0.1)
. Set OpenFire to use Embedded DB
. Create a group "OH" in the OpenFire server and enable the "Contact List (Roster) Sharing"
. Add new users automatically created from OH to the "OH" group
. Consideration should be given to using the OpenFire plugin to automatically add new users to a group (e.g., registration plugin http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugins/registration.jar)


=== 3.9 Bundles

Bundles are the language (or translation) files provided with Open Hospital. As described in the
<<language,LANGUAGE>> chapter, Open Hospital comes with different available languages in the folder *bundles/* within the package file:

*language_XY.properties*

where XY is an international country code.

These property files (text format) contain multiple *key = value* pairs containing localized text for the language specified.

All files must be encoded in *UTF-8* to accept any language-specific characters (e.g. è ì ò à ñ ú ù ¡ ¿ ...).


==== 3.9.1 New Translations

To create a new translation, simply copy the English file, rename it with the new country code in
place of the “XY” in the filename, and start translating with a simple text editor. A text editor can also be used to modify
existing translations that are incorrect.

For instance, if to create an Arabic translation, copy a new bundle from the English one by copying _language_en.properties_ to a *new file* _language_ar.properties_.

Then edit the Arabic bundle file and set the LANGUAGE parameter to *ar* to start testing the translation.

<<<

[#reports]
== 4 Reports

Reports in Open Hospital are produced with JasperReports® technology that allows one to design a report in a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) way, connect it to a datasource (DB), test it, modify it, and then compile it to use it in the application software.

Open Hospital reports are all contained in reports rpt/ folder (see <<folders,Folders>> in this document). Each report consists of two files:

* a .*jrxml* file: JasperReport XML file, that can be modified with a proper editor
* a .*jasper* file: Jasper file, that is the compiled version that can be run in Open Hospital; this file is produced on the jrxml base
* some reports could have also one or more *.properties* file that works for the localization, it means that the report has been translated to appear in more languages (default is English)

The editor to create and modify JasperReports® is https://sourceforge.net/projects/jasperstudio/[TIBCO Jaspersoft® Studio] version 6.14.0 or later, a free and open-source software.

With Jaspersoft® Studio it is possible to edit Open Hospital reports and re-compile them in the same location to be found and used by the Open Hospital application.

== 5 Installing Open Hospital 1.11.1 in Eclipse EE

WARNING: The code is available on GitHub at these links:
https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-core/tree/v1.11.0[openhospital-core],
https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-gui/tree/v1.11.0[openhospital-gui], and
https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-doc/tree/v1.11.0[openhospital-doc].

_Please use EGit (Eclipse Plugin for Git) to clone the code into the Eclipse instance._

Assuming Eclipse EE, MariaDB/MySQL and the Java Virtual Machine 1.8 or higher (Java8 or greater)
are already installed on the computer, this chapter will focus on cloning version 1.11.1 into the Eclipse J2EE (or Eclipse EE)
environment.

Please follow these
link:https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Working_with_remote_Repositories[EGit User Guide - Working with remote Repositories].


=== 5.1 Run the Project

NOTE: Before running the project, the DB must be created as explained in
chapter <<database-server,MySQL Server and Open Hospital DB>>.

To run the application, look for class _openhospital-gui/src/main/java/org/isf/menu/gui/Menu.java_, then right-click on it and choose _Run As -> Java Application_. If everything is OK, the splash screen will appear. If not, look in the Eclipse console for any error or warning messages.

image:OH-splash.png[image,width=390,height=298]

Open Hospital’s advanced features require “native” libraries generated to match the computer’s operating system. Right-click on the project’s name, then select _Run As -> Run Configurations_:

image:image62.png[image,width=604,height=377]

A “Run Configurations” window opens. Choose Java Application -> <application’s name> - Menu (1) on this example. Select the “Main” tab, write “angal” on the “Project” field and check if the “Main class” is org.isf.menu.gui.Menu.

Select the “Arguments” tab and fill the “VM arguments” path typing (on a single line):
[source]
----
-Dsun.java2d.dpiaware=false -Djava.library.path=lib\native\<OS name>
----

<OS name> can be “Mac_OS_X”, “Solaris”, “Linux”, “Win64” (for 64-bit Windows) or “Windows” (for 32-bit Windows)
according to the folder's schema found in the related folder “native”.
Click on “Run” to close the window and run the application.

image:image63.png[image,width=604,height=337]

Now that the run configuration settings have been selected, OH can be launched by just clicking on the “Run” button (shown below by an arrow).

image:image64.png[image,width=604,height=377] +
image:image65.png[image,width=604,height=377]

Because of the default settings, Open Hospital’s first run does not show the login window. The system defaults to “single-user” mode
by default. This can be verified by the “SINGLEUSER=yes” string on the third row of the <<settings-properties,settings.properties>> file.
In production use this is unacceptable as Open Hospital must be accessible only to the administrator and logged users.
Click on the triangle near the project’s name, do the same on the “rsc” subfolder and then double-click on the <<settings-properties,settings.properties>> file.

image:image66.png[image,width=604,height=273]

Replace “yes” with “no” on the “SINGLEUSER” row. Press CTRL+S (or Command+S on Mac) to save the change.
Now rerun the application and after the splash window, a “login” window opens.
Click on the drop-down menu to choose the role. To access as the administrator, select “admin” and type the password.
The default is “admin”. The administrator has the right to register users as guests.
Guests have to choose “guest” from the drop-down menu and then type their password.

image:image67.png[image,width=604,height=377] +

If the password is not correct, an error message is shown, asking the user to try again.

To better understand the processes built in the software also enable the “Standard Output” in
_log4j.properties_ as explained in the chapter <<log4j-properties,log4j.properties>>.

[#update-open-hospital]
== 6 Update Open Hospital

=== 6.1 Update Open Hospital - CLIENT mode

New releases, as well as this Admin Manual and the User Manual, are regularly released on Github/SourceForge. See the <<download,Download>> section for more details.
NOTE: Following instructions only apply between “official releases”.

Minor releases (if not otherwise specified) do not need changes to the database structure, so the working copy can be replaced on each client with the new one and then connect to the same DB
(see <<database-properties,database.properties>> and <<log4j-properties,log4j.properties>>).

It is important to keep/preserve files that have been created or modified, especially configuration/settings and data files (see <<configuration,Configuration>>).

The easiest way is to backup the working copy and re-apply those settings in the new installation
(see the <<backup-restore,Backup & Restore>> chapter).

*Major Releases*:

Changes are found in the CHANGELOG file.

Major releases always have changes to the DB, and these changes are implemented via different scripts included in the

|===

Thus the update process is as follows:

. Close the program if it is still running
. Backup the current DB for safety (see <<backup-restore,Backup & Restore>>)
. Open a terminal in the folder sql/ (e.g.):

[source,shell]
----
C:\WINDOWS\system32> cd C:\Users\OH\OpenHospital.1.11.1\sql

C:\Users\OH\OpenHospital.1.11.1\sql>
----

[start=4]
. Run the following commands (e.g.):

[source,shell]
----
C:\Users\OH\OpenHospital.1.11.1\sql> mysql –u root -p

Enter password: ****
----

[start=5]
. Use the ‘root’ password chosen during the installation process. The terminal should reply with the MySQL client command line prompt:

[source,shell]
----
mysql>
----

[start=6]
. Then execute all the SQL scripts that have been added from the previous version; for example:

[source,shell]
----
mysql> source step_34_slim_opd_table.sql

mysql> source step_35_doctors_log.sql

mysql> source step_36_patientexamination_and_rollback_step23.sql

. If any error message occurs you can report an issue here:+
 https://openhospital.atlassian.net/.
. If the procedure is successful, replace the OH working copy on each client with the new one and connect it to the same DB
(see <<database-properties,database.properties>> and <<log4j-properties,log4j.properties>>).
Remember to maintain the configuration files that have been changed, to preserve the custom settings.
(see <<configuration,Configuration>>). The most common way is to backup the working copy and re-apply those
settings in the new one (see <<backup-restore,Backup & Restore>>).
. Start the program and check the log files (data/logs) to ensure that the new version is running and has no error messages.
