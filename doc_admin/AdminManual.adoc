== Open Hospital

== 1 Abstract

This application is the first of a set of software products that ISFfootnote:[Informatici Senza Frontiere = Computer scientists without frontiers] has developed to support the management and the activities of the St. Luke Hospital in Angal (Uganda). After that initial mission, the St. Luke Hospital has become the first one of a long list of hospitals that have found this software useful.

All the work on this software is done as an open-sourcefootnote:[Open-source = software for which the original *source code* is made available to anyone free of charge.] project using only open-source development software.

This application software consists of the following parts:

* Pharmacy management
* Laboratory management
* OPD management
* Patient admission and discharge management
* Pregnancy management
* Malnutrition control management
* Vaccines database
* Patient billing support
* Therapy management
* Internal communication
* Statistics and printing

This document describes how to install the application and how to configure it in your environment. This includes enabling and disabling functionality as well as managing users.

The reader of this manual will not find the information one needs to use the application software; that information is found in our _User’s Guide_, supplied with the application software.

<<<

== 2 Introduction

The aim of this program is to manage, in the simplest manner, the hospital administrative operations like registering patients and laboratory analysis, and to produce statistics for the health ministry. In the following chapters one will find all the information needed to use the software properly.

<<<

== 3 Installation

=== 3.1 Open Hospital

Open Hospital is a stand-alone Javafootnote:[Java is a registered trademark of Oracle and/or its affiliates.] software program that does not require installation and is often known as a portable installation. The .zip file can be copied and moved everywhere in your system, whether the operating system is Windows or Linux.

The software acts as a client application. The server part utilizes a DBMS (Database Management System) to persist information. From the inception of the software, the free and open-source MySQLfootnode:[See https://www.mysql.com/] database system is the DBMS of choice.

The real part of the installation includes installing the JRE (Java Runtime Environment), installing the MySQL Server, and the creation of the database (DB). This installation is accomplished through the execution of a script in the folder mysql/ within the .zip file folders.

The classic installation schema in a regular wired LAN network is shown in the following figure:

image:image3.png[image,width=642,height=243]

The Administrator/Installer tasks are hereby listed:

NOTE: The minimum Java requirement is Java8 or greater (1.8 or greater).

TIP: If you see the application small-scaled, probably you are using a high-dpi display, in such cases there are some solutions (https://stackoverflow.com/a/39372897/5309541[click here]) to apply only on the machines using this kind of monitors.

* Install the Java Runtime Environment 1.8 or higher (1.8 is recommended for full compliance)
* Install the MySQL server on a computer that will act as the OH “server”
* Copy the Open Hospital application on every client (it may be installed on the server also)
* Configure each Open Hospital copy to point to the MySQL server (using the hostname or the IP address)

For the Java Runtime Environment installation refer to the next chapter <<jre,Java Runtime Environment>>
and the online documentation.

For the MySQL installation and DB creation refer to the chapter <<mysql-server,MySQL Server and Open Hospital DB>> and the online documentation.

For the Open Hospital installation on every client, it is sufficient to copy and extract the zip file on the machine.

For the Open Hospital configuration refer to the chapter <<config-files,Configuration Files>>.

[#jre]
==== 3.1.1 Java Runtime Environment

Depending on the operating system, there are different ways to install a Java Virtual Machine and the Java Runtime Environment.

For instance, on a Microsoft Windows® system, you have to download and execute a setup file, while on Linux based systems you have to type only one command in a terminal.

NOTE: The minimum Java requirement is Java8 or greater (1.8 or greater).

TIP: If you see the application small-scaled, probably you are using a high-dpi display, in such cases there are some solutions (https://stackoverflow.com/a/39372897/5309541[click here]) to apply only on the machines using this kind of monitor.

[#mysql-server]
==== 3.1.2 MySQL Server and Open Hospital DB

Depending on the operating system you have, there are several pieces of software to download to install and manage a MySQL server. In most cases one downloads a standard installation file of the software, paying attention to configuration options during the installation process.

For instance, on a Microsoft Windows® system, you will have MySQL Workbench® as a client, while in Linux based systems you may have MySQL Administrator and MySQL Query Browser to perform the same tasks. Some newer distributions (distros) include MySQL Workbench.

The best approach for installation is to use the command-line MySQL client which uses essentially the same commands and syntax for every platform.

NOTE: The DB creation and the software itself are only tested with MySQL Server 5.7.x. Any other version may have problems during the DB creation process.

===== 3.1.2.1 MySQL Server installation

Please referer to the latest MySQL Server online documentation for downloadfootnote:[https://www.mysql.com/downloads/] and installationfootnote:[https://dev.mysql.com/doc/] information as you continue reading this document.

Generally, the main aspects the Administrator has to pay attention to are:

* *on a Linux machine*: during the installation it will ask for a “root” password; it is very important to choose it carefully and to keep it safely in an installation document. If the password is not prompted for during installation an empty password will be automatically set for the root user.
* *on a Windows machine*: during the installation it will ask for several configuration options; the best configuration is (it options could differ a bit):

* *Custom Installation*
* Install all components except Developer ones
* Select *Detailed Configuration*
* Select *Server Machine*
* Select *Multifunctional Database*
* Set a minimum of concurrent connection as the number of clients multiplied by two
* Select *Enable TCP/IP Networking* and write down the *Port Number* in an installation document
* Select UTF8 as the default charset for *Best Support For Multilingualism*
* Select *Install As Window Service*
* Select *Include Bin Directory In Windows PATH*
* Select *Modify Security Settings*, choose the *root password*, and write it down in an installation document

Once the installation has been completed, the next stop is the Open Hospital DB creation. To check if the server is active and running,  open a terminal window (command prompt) and type the following command:

*# mysql –u root -p*

*Enter password: *****

The terminal should reply with the MySQL client command line prompt:

*mysql>*

The prompt means there is a successful connection to the MySQL Server instance that was just installed as evidenced by it waiting for commands to execute.

NOTE: If the terminal does not reply as above most probably during installation the *Include Bin Directory in Windows PATH* option was not selected and therefore Windows can not find the mysql command. If this is the case you can add the path manually by searching "system variables" in the Control Panel or append the full path to the "mysql" command (e.g., "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0\bin\mysql" [with the quotes]). Another option is to uninstall and reinstall MySQL with the *Include* option selected.

====== 3.1.2.1.1 Networking

On Linux systems, MySQL server must be configured to enable networking; this can be achieved by changing MySQL's config file, “my.cnf”, and commenting out the "bind-address" parameter (using the *#* character)

Change:

[source,properties]
----
# Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.
bind-address               = 127.0.0.1
----

To:

[source,properties]
----
# Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.
#bind-address               = 127.0.0.1
----

====== 3.1.2.1.2 Performance

Improved performance in a production environment can be achieved by changing the following parameters in the MySQL config file, “my.cnf”:

Change:

[source,properties]
----
#
# Query Cache Configuration
#
query-cache_limit = 1M
query-cache_size = 16M
----

To:

[source,properties]
----
#
# Query Cache Configuration
#
query-cache_limit = 11M
query-cache_size = 256M
----

====== 3.1.2.1.3 Table name cases ([.underline]#before creating the DB#)

MySQL is case-sensitive on Unix and case-insensitive on Microsoft systems, so scripts that work on Windows may not work on Linux depending on how carefully they were coded.

For this reason, if the DB is shared between different operating systems it is recommended to change the following parameter in the MySQL config file “my.cnf” of each system, as in https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/identifier-case-sensitivity.html

===== 3.1.2.2 Create Open Hospital DB

To create the Open Hospital database everything required is found in a set of SQL script files contained in the Open Hospital ([.underline]#non-portable#) zip file in the folder mysql/.

If the *Include Bin Directory In Windows PATH* is selected during the installation process (in Linux is always true) we can run the MySQL client everywhere in our system, otherwise, go back to that chapter and read the *NOTE* in the box.

Open a terminal in the folder mysql/ (e.g.):

[source,shell]
----
C:\WINDOWS\system32> cd D:\OpenHospital_1_11_0\mysql

D:\OpenHospital_1_11_0\mysql>
----

and run the following command (e.g.):

[source,shell]
----
D:\OpenHospital_1_11_0\mysq> mysql –u root -p
Enter password: *****
----

Using the ‘root’ password you have chosen during the installation process. The terminal should reply with the MySQL client command line prompt:

[source,shell]
----
mysql>
----

Next launch the main script “create_all_en.sql” with the command:

[source,shell]
----
mysql> source create_all_en.sql
----

NOTE: You can install the data with different languages by using the related "create_all_xx.sql" file, or with demo data using the "create_all_demo.sql" file (English only).

NOTE: If the error message "ERROR 1148 (42000): The used command is not allowed with this MySQL version" appears you need to enable the "local infile" command on the
client by logging in again and specifying the "--local-infile=1" parameter after the "-p"; thus "mysql -u root -p --local-infile=1".

The server processes the create script and after some time it is ready again for a new prompt. At this point, the DB has been
created and it can be checked with the command:

[source,shell]
----
mysql> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| oh                 |
| performance_schema |
+--------------------+
----

The script created the DB populated it with some default data, and created the “isf” user with password “isf123”.

The ‘isf’ user, different from the ‘root’ one, is the user that the Open Hospital software uses to connect to the DB and its password must be changed immediately with the command:

[source,shell]
----
mysql>SET PASSWORD FOR isf'@'%' = PASSWORD('new-password-here');

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

Rows matched: 1 Changed: 1 Warnings: 0
----

And then:

[source,shell]
----
mysql>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
----

When we are through, we exit the MySQL client command line with the command:

[source,shell]
----
mysql>quit;
----

==== 3.1.3 Configure Open Hospital

Open Hospital comes with several configuration files called “properties files”. The one we need to modify to let Open Hospital find its database is the _database.properties_ and _log4j.properties_ files, located in the “resource” folder rsc/.

We have to specify:

* the *IP address* of the machine where the MySQL Server was installed and containing the Open Hospital database. Replace “localhost” with the IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
* the “isf” user *password*, if changed from “isf123”
* the MySQL Server *Port Number*, if changed from “3306”

NOTE: These settings are required for every Open Hospital copy, that is to say, on every client.

More information on these files can be found in the sections <<database-properties,database.properties>> and
<<log4j-properties,log4j.properties>>.

==== 3.1.4 Run Open Hospital

We are ready now to run the Open Hospital software by executing the proper launcher:

* *on a Linux machine*: startup.sh
* *on a Windows machine*: startup.cmd

If everything is ok you should see the Open Hospital main splash screen:

image:image17.jpeg[Splash.jpg,width=316,height=237]

And then the main Menu:

image:image18.png[MainMenu.PNG,width=135,height=306]

You may create a shortcut (link) to the executable script on the Desktop, the Programs Menu or wherever you need by using the provided icon “oh.ico” that you find in the package.

image:image100.png[oh.ico,width=32,height=32]

=== 3.2 Portable Open Hospital

Open Hospital is also distributed in a portable format.

Since Open Hospital is a Java software program, it is portable by definition. The term “portable” here refers to the possibility of having a self-contained copy of the software that includes Java, MySQL Server, and the DB. This package can be copied and run everywhere, carrying together all the inserted data.

Since the JRE and MySQL are not platform-independent and come in different versions depending on the platform, we have:

* *Portable Open Hospital for Linux* platforms (embedding Java JRE and MySQL for Linux, 32 or 64bit)
* *Portable Open Hospital for Windows* platforms (embedding Java JRE and MySQL for Windows)

NOTE: The minimum Java requirement is Java8 or greater (1.8 or greater).

TIP: If you see the application small-scaled, probably you are using a high-dpi display, in such cases there are some solutions (https://stackoverflow.com/a/39372897/5309541[click here]) to apply only on the machines using this kind of monitors.

Once the required version is downloaded, you may start it by launching the related script inside the package:

* *oh.sh* in the Linux version
* *oh.bat* in the Windows version

No other configuration is needed. On Linux, additional options can be shown by executing *oh.sh -h*.

NOTE: If you want to use a Portable Open Hospital for Linux from a USB key you need to make sure that the file permissions in the
archive remain unchanged once extracted, otherwise you will not be able to start the launcher or use the application in an
appropriate manner.

NOTE: It is important to understand that the portable version is meant to be a trial, that is, to have a look at the software
or used in a very small facility (like a dispensary) with only one computer. If the facility is large and needs a networked
architecture, the full installation version is recommended.

[#config-files]
== 5 Configuration Files

Customization of Open Hospital depends on settings set in text files called “properties files”. Open Hospital comes with 6 main properties files:

* *oh/rsc/*
** *database.properties* – for Open Hospital database connection
** *dicom.properties* – for the DICOM viewer module
** *examination.properties* – contains the settings for the ‘examination’ module
** *log4j.properties* – for the logging system
** *settings.properties* – for configuring Open Hospital options
** *sms.properties* – for the SMS Manager module
** *txtPrinter.properties*– for the text printing system
** *xmpp.properties* – for the Xmpp Server

Furthermore, other configurations files that are not meant to be modified by the user:

* *resolutions.xml* –  stores locally the information about webcams
* *version.properties* – contains the current Open Hospital version

Every configuration file works only [.underline]#locally# and is meant to manage  [.underline]#only a single instance# of Open Hospital application.

This means that if there are many clients running Open Hospital they may run differently according to their own configuration files.

NOTE: Any change to these files requires an application restart to see the modifications applied.

The following chapters will describe these properties files and their features in detail.

[#settings-properties]
=== 5.1 settings.properties

The default settings.properties file is:

Every line is composed of a key (capitalized) and a value of the form:

key=value

Furthermore, values can be:

* *Boolean*: yes | no or true | false
* *String*: usually a filename or a country code (ISO 3166-1)

In following chapters will describe the meaning of each of the key/value pairs.

[#language]
==== 5.1.1 LANGUAGE

The following table shows the default value and the allowed ones:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Key |Default Value | Allowed Values
|LANGUAGE |en |ar, en, it, fr, es, de, sw
|===

Open Hospital ships with nine translations, identified by the international country code:

* ar – Arabic
* de - German
* en – English
* es – Spanish
* fr – French
* it – Italian
* pt – Portuguese
* sw – Swahili
* zh_CN - simplified Chinese

You can change the language used in the application simply by editing *_settings.properties_* and setting this key.
If an unknown value is set, the local computer language is applied.

NOTE: An application restart is required to see the modification applied.

==== 5.1.2 SINGLEUSER

The following table shows the default value and the allowed ones:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Key |Default Value | Allowed Values
|SINGLEUSER |yes |yes, no
|===

Open Hospital is designed to support multi-user usage. This means that is possible to define different users, arrange them by group and set different rights in application usage; for instance, a user “receptionist” may be able to register a new patient but not to prescribe a therapy.

Open Hospital has a predefined user called “admin” that has all rights to access all the functionality of the application.
When SINGLEUSER is set to YES (default) the program starts with this user and all the program functionality is available.

If SINGLEUSER is set to NO the following login window appears when the program is started:

image:image24.PNG[Login.PNG,width=305,height=148]

The default password for the “admin” user is “admin”. After typing this password in the white field and pressing *[.underline]##S##ubmit*, you will see the main *_Menu_* with all functionalities enabled.

Once logged in as the “admin” user you can define users and groups (see the
link:https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-doc/blob/develop/doc_user/UserManual.adoc#15-users-groups-file-users[Users & Groups] chapter in the User's Guide), or just continue with a simple form of data protection.

NOTE: The setting is client-side specific, this means that one can disable the login on a specific client, but logons will still
be required on other clients, with the same defined user and groups. (This behavior may change in newer versions of the product.)

WARNING: Data security must never be left solely to the application but it must include proper network architecture and a rigid configuration of the clients.

==== 5.1.3 AUTOMATICLOT

The following table shows the default value and the alternatives for lot management:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Key |Default Value |Valid Values
|AUTOMATICLOT_IN |no |yes, no
|AUTOMATICLOT_OUT |no |yes, no
|AUTOMATICLOTWARD_TOWARD |no |yes, no
|===

Open Hospital allows for automatic management of lots in the main pharmacy.
This means that is possible to work in the pharmacy without taking care of lot definitions in loading the store and
just specify preparation and expiring date for each charging movement
(see link:https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-doc/blob/develop/doc_user/UserManual.adoc#6-2-2-2-insert-stock-charging-movement-charge[6.2.2.2 Insert stock charging movement] in the User's Guide).

For discharging movement, the lot is automatically calculated according to the nearest expiring date of lots (FEFO - First Expiring First Out). If the quantity to discharge is larger than the quantity of the first selected lot, more than one discharging operation can be generated.

_AUTOMATIC LOTS MANAGEMENT_ is split into two different settings for charging and discharging the main pharmacy and to manage lots also in the wards.
In this way, more control is given to the user that may want to provide all the lots' details in _charging operations_ but ask the application to automatically _discharge_ the nearest expiring ones (FEFO).
Similarly, in wards (see link:https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-doc/blob/develop/doc_user/UserManual.adoc#6-3-pharmaceuticals-stock-ward-pharmaceuticals-stock-ward[6.3 Pharmaceuticals Stock Ward] in the User's Guide)
the user may decide to manage lots manually or to ask the application to do it automatically.

With *AUTOMATICLOT_IN = YES* the application generates a lot number automatically and only asks for an expiration date (mandatory). By default, AUTOMATICLOT_IN is set to NO. It is possible to change the value at any time.

With *AUTOMATICLOT_OUT = YES* the application discharges automatically the nearest expiring lot when required. By default, AUTOMATICLOT_OUT is set to NO. It is possible to change the value at any time.

With *AUTOMATICLOTWARD_TOWARD = YES*, the application discharges from a Ward (to other Wards) the nearest expiring lot automatically when required. By default, AUTOMATICLOTWARD_TOWARD is set to NO. It is possible to change the value at any time.
For discharges to Patients (drug giving) the lot is *never* asked.

NOTE: An application restart is required to see the modification applied for all the above settings.

==== 5.1.4 LOTWITHCOST

The following table shows the default value and the allowed ones:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Key |Default Value |Valid Values
|LOTWITHCOST |yes |yes, no
|===

Open Hospital allows for managing the cost of medicals in the main pharmacy
(see link:https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-doc/blob/develop/doc_user/UserManual.adoc#6-2-2-2-insert-stock-charging-movement-charge[6.2.2.2 Insert stock charging movement] in the User's Guide).

NOTE: An application restart is required to see the modification applied.

==== 5.1.5 PATIENTSHEET

The following table shows the default value and the allowed ones:

[cols=",,",options="header",]

The exception is the PORT parameter which must be changed to match the SERIAL port used by your system to address the device once plugged in the system.

If you are sure the PORT is correct but still Open Hospital is not communicating with the device (we suggest switching to DEBUG log level – or lower - during this setup –
see <<log4j-properties,log4j.properties>>) you might use the SetupGSM utility in your Open Hospital root folder
(see <<folders,Folders>>).

To use the SetupGSM utility just follow these instructions:

. Plug your device in your system and be sure the system recognizes it, load a proper driver for it and assign a serial port (COM)
. Launch the utility: the utility will scan all plugged devices and will try to recognize the modem (or phone) within them
. If the device is recognized as a modem you will be prompted for a confirmation message as follows:

image:image25.png[image,width=293,height=120]
[start=4]
. If the name of the device is the one meant to be used with the system then just click “yes”, otherwise click “no”, and the scan will continue
. Once you click “yes” the sms.properties file will be automatically modified by the utility

This file is not meant to be modified by the user.

Once the system is up and running, the log level can be reduced from "DEBUG" to "INFO", so the log files are significantly reduced in size:

[source,properties]
----
log4j.category.org.isf=INFO,RollingFile
----

Alternatively, in case of malfunctions of the application, the log level can be increased to "TRACE" so more detail on the operation of the application can be recorded:

[source,properties]
----
log4j.category.org.isf=TRACE,RollingFile
----

Logging can be routed to the database (DB) by adding the respective *appender*:

[source,properties]
----
log4j.category.org.isf=INFO,RollingFile,DB
----


You can also decide to log only in the standard output (the console window) with:

[source,properties]
----
log4j.category.org.isf=INFO,RollingFile,StdOut
----

If the DB appender is specified then the configuration must be set to match those in the database.properties file
(see <<database-properties,database.properties>>). The most important properties are those highlighted in *red* below:

* *key*: your api key (if you purchased sms) from Textbelt provider (one can use "textbelt" to send 1 free sms per day)
* *ribbon.base-url*: The URL of the Textbelt HTTP API.

[#txtprinter-properties]
===  5.8 txtPrinter.properties

The default txtPrinter.properties file is:

[source,properties]
----
# This file contains text printing information
# MODE = TXT, PDF or ZPL
USE_DEFAULT_PRINTER=yes
PRINT_AS_PAID=no
PRINT_WITHOUT_ASK=no
MODE=PDF
#TXT_CHAR_HEIGHT=10
#TXT_CHAR_WIDTH=10
ZPL_FONT_TYPE=0
ZPL_ROW_HEIGHT=25
----

This file is used only if the RECEIPTPRINTER flag is enabled (see <<receiptprinter,RECEIPTPRINTER>> in this document).

The file has seven parameters:

* *USE_DEFAULT_PRINTER*: If it is set to _yes_, Open Hospital will use the default printer, otherwise it will show the system
printing dialog allowing a change to the printer at every print attempt:

image:image42.png[image,width=291,height=245]

* *PRINT_AS_PAID*: This changes the behavior when a Bill is set to PAID in the Accounting module
(see link:https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-doc/blob/develop/doc_user/UserManual.adoc#8-1-2-11-print-receipt-function[8.2.1.11 Print receipt] function in User’s Guide). +
 ** If it is set to _yes_, Open Hospital will try to print a receipt just after a Bill is set to PAID +
 *** A confirmation window will appear (see below), otherwise you must do it after, by pressing the *[.underline]##E##dit Bill* button on the already closed (“C”) bill

image:image43.png[Accountin_print_as_paid.PNG,width=268,height=118]

* *PRINT_WITHOUT_ASK*: if set to yes Open Hospital will try to print the receipt without the confirmation window
* *MODE*: the MODE can take three values:
** *TXT*: the bill is printed as pure text (no graphics)
** *PDF*: the bill will be printed as a PDF
** *ZPL*: the text printer connected to the system works with ZPL language (an EPL evolution for Zebra Label Printer)
* *ZPL_FONT_TYPE*: a 0 (zero) value stands for a standard character; you may change this value to “A”, “B”, “C”, etc. according to the device datasheet, to obtain a better look
* *ZPL_FONT_SIZE*: an integer value to adjust the character size to obtain a better look

The best way to set these parameters for your device is to set them one by one and check the different results until you reach the best fit.

NOTE: An application restart is required to see the modification applied.

[#xmpp-properties]
=== 5.9 xmpp.properties

Open Hospital 1.7 and greater versions, come with the xmpp.properties file set as follows by default:

[source,properties]
----
# This file contains Xmpp Server information
DOMAIN=127.0.0.1
PORT=5222
----

This file is used only if the XMPPMODULEENABLED flag is enabled (see <<xmppmoduleenabled,XMPPMODULEENABLED>> in this document).

To use the Communication module
(see link:https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-doc/blob/develop/doc_user/UserManual.adoc#13-communication-communication[13 Communication] in the User’s Guide), you must install an
XMPP Server separately on the OH Server, typically on the same location as the MySQL Server.

The most common XMPP Server is the free and open-source project Ignite Openfire® (http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/) available for Linux, Windows, and Mac.

Once the XMPP Server is installed, active and running set the two parameters in the xmpp.properties file as follows:

* *DOMAIN* – the IP address of the XMPP server (it could be the same as the MySQL Server)
* *PORT* – 5222 or another if set differently

NOTE: An application restart is required to see the modification applied.

==== 5.9.1 OpenFire Settings

The XMPP module needs some knowledge about XMPP protocol and how an XMPP server works.

Every time you log into Open Hospital, it will create an OpenFire user with the same username and password (even if passwords are saved
differently in OH and OpenFire DB). For this reason, OH "admin" user conflict with OpenFire one, so you will not be able to
log in as admin and to chat.

NOTE: If you need the admin user to chat with other users you may consider creating another "superuser" in OH
under the "admin" group.

To allow users to see each other and communicate via XMPP protocol, they must belong to the same OpenFire "group" and have the other users in their own "_roster_" (you can find "group" and "roster" deep explanation in the online documentation).

Please follow these settings:

. Install OpenFire server (better if from the zip file) on a writable path in your OS
. Set in both OpenFire and xmpp.properties an IP address rather than the FQDN (e.g. 127.0.0.1)
. Set OpenFire to use Embedded DB
. Create a group "OH" in the OpenFire server and enable the "Contact List (Roster) Sharing"
. Add new users automatically created from OH to the "OH" group
. You may consider using the OpenFire plugin to automatically add new users to a group (e.g., registration plugin http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugins/registration.jar)

=== 5.10 Bundles

Bundles are the language (or translation) files provided with Open Hospital. As described in the
<<language,LANGUAGE>> chapter, Open Hospital 1.7 and later versions, comes with different available languages in the folder *bundles/* within the package file:

*language_XY.properties*

where XY is an international country code.

These files are property files (a text file), which contains multiple *key = value* pairs containing localized text for the language specified.

All files must be encoded in *UTF-8* to accept any language-specific characters (e.g. è ì ò à ñ ú ù ¡ ¿ ...).

==== 5.10.1 New Translations

To create a new translation, one can simply copy the English file, rename it with the new country code in
place of the “XY” in the filename, and start translating with a simple text editor. A text editor can also be used to modify
existing translations that are incorrect.

For instance, if you want to create an Arab translation, you copy a new bundle from the English one by copying _language_en.properties_ into a *new file* _language_ar.properties_.


Then you can edit the Arab file and set the LANGUAGE parameter to *ar* to start testing your translation.

<<<

[#reports]
== 6 Reports

Reports in Open Hospital are produced with JasperReports® technology that allows one  to design a report in a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) way, connect it to a datasource (DB), test it, modify it, and then compile it to use it in the application software.

Open Hospital reports are all contained in reports rpt/ folder (see <<folders,Folders>> in this document). Each report consists of two files:

* a .*jrxml* file: JasperReport XML file, that can be modified with a proper editor
* a .*jasper* file: Jasper file, that is the compiled version that can be run in Open Hospital; this file is produced on the jrxml base
* some reports could have also one or more *.properties* file that works for the localization, it means that the report has been translated to appear in more languages (default is English)

The editor to create and modify JasperReports® is https://sourceforge.net/projects/jasperstudio/[TIBCO Jaspersoft® Studio] version 6.14.0 or later, a free and open-source software.

With Jaspersoft® Studio it is possible to edit Open Hospital reports and re-compile them in the same location to be found and used by the Open Hospital application.

== 7 Installing Open Hospital 1.11.0 in Eclipse EE

WARNING: The code is available on GitHub at these links:
https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-core/tree/v1.11.0[openhospital-core],
https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-gui/tree/v1.11.0[openhospital-gui], and
https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-doc/tree/v1.11.0[openhospital-doc].

_Please use EGit (Eclipse Plugin for Git) to clone the code into your Eclipse instance._

Assuming Eclipse EE, MySQL 5.7.x, and the Java Virtual Machine 1.8 or higher (Java8 or greater)
are already installed on the computer, this chapter will focus on cloning version 1.11 into the Eclipse J2EE (or Eclipse EE)
environment.

Please follow these
link:https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Working_with_remote_Repositories[EGit User Guide - Working with remote Repositories].

=== 7.1 Run the Project

NOTE: Before running the project, the DB must be created as explained in
chapter <<mysql-server,MySQL Server and Open Hospital DB>>.

To run the application, look for class _openhospital-gui/src/main/java/org/isf/menu/gui/Menu.java_, then right-click on it and choose _Run As -> Java Application_. If everything is OK, the splash screen will appear. If not, look in the Eclipse console for any error or warning messages.

image:image1.jpeg[image,width=390,height=298]

Open Hospital’s advanced features require “native” libraries generated to match the computer’s operating system. Right-click on the project’s name, then select _Run As -> Run Configurations_:

image:image62.PNG[image,width=604,height=377]

A “Run Configurations” window opens. Choose Java Application -> <application’s name> - Menu (1) on this example. Select the “Main” tab, write “angal” on the “Project” field and check if the “Main class” is org.isf.menu.gui.Menu.

Select the “Arguments” tab and fill the “VM arguments” path typing (on a single line):
[source]
----
-Dsun.java2d.dpiaware=false -Djava.library.path=lib\native\<OS name>
----

<OS name> can be “Mac_OS_X”, “Solaris”, “Linux”, “Win64” (for 64-bit Windows) or “Windows” (for 32-bit Windows)
according to the folder's schema you find in the related folder “native”.
Click on “Run” to close the window and run the application.

image:image63.png[image,width=604,height=337]

Now that the run configuration settings have been selected, OH can be launched by just clicking on the “Run” button (shown below by an arrow).

image:image64.png[image,width=604,height=377] +
image:image65.png[image,width=604,height=377]

Because of the default settings, Open Hospital’s first run does not show the login window. The system defaults to “single user” mode
as default. This can be verified by the “SINGLEUSER=yes” string on the third row of the <<generaldata-properties,generalData.properties>> file.
In production use this is unacceptable as Open Hospital must be accessible only to the administrator and logged users.
Click on the triangle near the project’s name, do the same on the “rsc” subfolder and then double-click on the <<generaldata-properties,generalData.properties>> file.

image:image66.png[image,width=604,height=273]

Replace “yes” with “no” on the “SINGLEUSER” row. Press CTRL+S (or Command+S on Mac) to save the change.
Now rerun the application and after the splash window, a “login” window opens.
Click on the drop-down menu to choose the role. To access as the administrator, select “admin” and type the password.
The default is “admin”. The administrator has the right to register users as guests.
Guests have to choose “guest” from the drop-down menu and then type their password.

image:image67.png[image,width=604,height=377] +

If the password is not correct, an error message is shown, asking the user to try again.

To better understand the processes underneath the software you may also enable the “Standard Output” in
log4j.properties as explained in the chapter <<log4j-properties,log4j.properties>>.

[#update-open-hospital]
== 8 Update Open Hospital

=== 8.1 Update Open Hospital (non-portable)

NOTE: Following instructions only applies between “official releases” downloaded from the SourceForge website.

New releases, as well as this Manual and the User Manual, are regularly released on SourceForge platform at the link: +
https://sourceforge.net/projects/openhospital/files/

There are two types of releases:

. Major Releases: the first or second number changes (e.g. **1.**7.3 -> **1.**8.0)
. Minor Releases: only the third number changes (e.g. **1.8.**1 -> **1.8.**2)

*Minor Releases*:

Changes are found in the CHANGELOG file.

Minor Releases (if not otherwise specified) do not need changes to the DB, so you can replace your working copy on each client with the new one and connect it to the same DB
(see <<database-properties,database.properties>> and <<log4j-properties,log4j.properties>>).

Remember to keep files that have been changed, especially configuration settings (see <<config-files,Configuration Files>>).
The most common way is to backup your working copy and re-apply those settings in the new installation
(see the <<backup-restore,Backup & Restore>> chapter).

*Major Releases*:

Changes are found in the CHANGELOG file.

Major Releases always have changes to the DB, and these changes are implemented via different scripts included in the
mysql folder (e.g.):

[cols=",",options="header",]

*step_54_enable_sms_on_visits.sql*

|===

Thus the update process is as follows:

. Close the program if it is still running
. Backup your current DB for safety (see <<backup-restore,Backup & Restore>>)
. Open a terminal in the folder mysql/ (e.g.):

[source,shell]
----
C:\WINDOWS\system32> cd D:\OpenHospital_1_11_0\mysql

D:\OpenHospital_1_11_0\mysql>
----

[start=4]
. Run the following commands (e.g.):

[source,shell]
----
D:\OpenHospital_1_11_0\mysql> mysql –u root -p

Enter password: ****
----

[start=5]
. Using the ‘root’ password you have chosen during the installation process. The terminal should reply with the MySQL client command line prompt:

[source,shell]
----
mysql>
----

[start=6]
. We launch all scripts in order that that differ from the previous version; for example:

[source,shell]
----
mysql> source step_34_slim_opd_table.sql

mysql> source step_35_doctors_log.sql

mysql> source step_36_patientexamination_and_rollback_step23.sql

mysql> source step_37_suppliers_table.sql

mysql> source step_38_dicom.sql

mysql> source step_39_patientfolder_submenu.sql

...
----

[start=7]
. Take notes if any error message occurs and report them to: +
https://sourceforge.net/p/openhospital/support-requests/
. If everything is successful, replace your working copy on each client with the new one and connect it to the same DB
(see <<database-properties,database.properties>> and <log4j-properties,log4j.properties>>).
Remember to keep files that have been changed, especially any changes to the configuration settings
(see <<config-files,Configuration Files>>). The most common way is to backup your working copy and re-apply those
settings in the new one (see <<backup-restore,Backup & Restore>>).
. Start the program and check from log files (OpenHospital_1_8_0/logs) to ensure the new version running and has no error messages.

=== 8.2 Update Open Hospital “portable”

NOTE: Open Hospital portable is not meant to be used in a production environment so, if you want to update a portable version to keep the previous data, we strongly suggest switching to a full installation as follows:

[arabic]
. MySQL Server installation
. Start Open Hospital portable and while running (port 3307):
[loweralpha]
.. <<backup-data,Backup of data (Database)>>
. Close Open Hospital portable
. <<restore-data,Restore of data (Database)>>
. Change settings to point to the new database (see <<database-properties,database.properties>> and <log4j-properties,log4j.properties>>)

To update the Open Hospital “portable” version without performing a full installation, please contact us at:
info@informaticisenzafrontiere.org and specify:

* A brief history of your installation and your use of Open Hospital
* The current Open Hospital version and the version you want to move to
* Your country and the language used
* Complete the https://goo.gl/forms/rXgcYTWpAyp9Eyqw1[Open Hospital Assessment online-form] form
