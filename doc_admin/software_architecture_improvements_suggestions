OpenHospital currently uses these software architecture elements:

Layered Architecture : 
User Interface (GUI): Layer facilitates user interaction with the system.
Business Logic Layer: Contains business rules and application logic, provided by the Open Hospital Core library.
Data Access Layer: This layer manages database operations and interaction. The system is configured to work with databases like MySQL or MariaDB.

Client-Server Architecture:
Open Hospital is designed to operate in both single-user and multi-user environments.
Single-User Mode: Can run on a single computer without installation.
Multi-User Mode: Supports a client-server structure where multiple users can access the same database.

Modular Architecture:
Core Component: business logic and data access layers.
GUI Component: Provides the user interface.
API Component: Enables integration with other applications.
Documentation Component: Contains user and administrator documentation.

Multitier Architecture:
Presentation Layer: Contains the user interface.
Application Layer: Hosts the business logic.
Data Layer: Manages database operations.

This architectural style might cause issues:
The business logic, user interface, and data layers are tightly coupled.
Adding new features might require changes across all layers.

Disadvantages of the Previous System:
High Coupling: There are tight dependencies between layers.  
Lack of Flexibility: Adding new features or modifying existing components is complex because all layers are affected.
Code Duplication: Similar functionalities may be implemented across multiple layers.
Testing Difficulties: Tight interdependencies might make it hard to test individual components.

Proposal: Transaction to Microkernel Architecture:

Core: Provides essential functionalities.
Plugins: New features are developed as independent modules.

Possible Advantages:
High Cohesion: Each plugin will only focus on its task. The core will contain only fundamental functions.
Low Coupling: Plugins will be independent and communicate only with the core.
Dynamic Extensibility: New features can be added without impacting the existing system.

Proposed Changes:
Core Definition: Define and implement the core system functionalities.
Plugin API: Develop an API to enable seamless interaction between the core and plugins.
Patient management plugin: Encapsulates all patient-related functions.
Dynamic Loading: Support for runtime loading and unloading of plugins.

Outcome: The system will become dynamically extensible and more modular. Cohesion will increase, and coupling will decrease.
