== Open Hospital

== 1 Introduction

OH - Open Hospital (https://www.open-hospital.org/) is a free and open-source Electronic Health Record (EHR) software application.
Open Hospital is deployed as a desktop application that can be used in a standalone, single user mode (PORTABLE mode)
or in a client / server network configuration (CLIENT mode), where multiple clients and users connect to the same database server.

Open Hospital is developed in Java and it is based on open-source tools and libraries; it runs on any computer, requires low resources and is designed to work without an internet connection.

Open Hospital is the first of a set of software applications that ISFfootnote:[Informatici Senza Frontiere - https://www.informaticisenzafrontiere.org] has developed to support the information management and the activities of hospitals and health centers in the simplest manner possible, by providing tools for the administrative operations (like registering patients, manage laboratory analysis and pharmaceutical stocks) and to produce detailed statistics and reports.
It was first deployed in 2006 at the St. Luke Hospital in Angal (Uganda) and it is now used in dozens of different locations around the world.

=== 1.1 Main Features

OH - Open Hospital features include:

* Pharmacy management
* Laboratory management
* OPD management
* Patient admission and discharge management
* Pregnancy management
* Malnutrition control management
* Vaccines database
* Patient billing support
* Therapy management
* Appointment scheduling
* Internal communication
* Statistics and printing

=== 1.2 About this User Manual

In the following chapters, all the information needed to use correctly and efficiently the OH software is presented.
More information can be found on the Open Hospital web site: https://www.open-hospital.org.

NOTE: The information needed to install, configure or administer Open Hospital is not included in this manual; please refer to the _Open Hospital Administrator’s Guide_ supplied with the software.

==== 1.2.1 Help

* The *[.underline]##H##elp* function available on the bottom of the main MENU of Open Hospital provides access to
this document [.underline]#offline#.

==== 1.2.2 Legend

In this document the following conventions are used:

* When a text is written in bold and highlighted in grey *–*
like *[.underline]##P##harmacy* or *[.underline]##N##ew –* it indicates a function of the application and it is also
called a “button”. *[.underline]##P##harmacy* is a button.

* When a text is written in bold Italic (as an example, *_Laboratory Browser)_* it indicates the screen with the name
“Laboratory Browser” (see example below). Each screen of the application is called a window. *_Laboratory Browser_* is a window.

* When a text is written in bold as - *Search patient visits –* it indicates a function of the application,
or an area of the window (for example, *Data table*).

* Each button always has a single letter with an underscore. The functionality offered by the button is made available by
pressing the “Alt” key and at the same time the “underlined” key (in the example of *[.underline]##P##harmacy*,
press “Alt” and “P”)*.* This behavior is common throughout the application and allows the user to operate (almost)
without the use of the mouse. In this document, the “Alt” key and the “P” key will be indicated as “Alt + P”.

.Click with the mouse on the button or press "Alt + P" to enter the *Pharmacy*
[#default-main-menu-3]
[caption="Main Menu: "]
image:OH-main_menu.png[OH Main Menu]

* Each screen of the application is a called “window”. Most complex windows of the application are composed of more than one
area. Areas can be a *Selection panel*, a *Data table*, or a *Buttons panel* (see *_Laboratory Browser_* window below).

image:image3.png[Window areas,width=642,height=464]

* To highlight an entry (for example, a single line in a *Data table*) click the mouse on the entry.
The entry (the entire line) is then highlighted in blue. This behavior is valid throughout the application (see example below):

=== 3.2 Functions of Out Patient Department

All functions available under *[.underline]##O##PD* are accessible from the window *_OPD Out Patient Department_* shown below:

image:image9.png[OPD,width=800,height=319]

The following functions are available from the *Buttons panel* of the window *_OPD Out Patient Department_*:

* *[.underline]##N##ew*: create a new patient visit.
* *[.underline]##E##dit*: modify an existing patient visit.
* *[.underline]##D##elete*: delete a patient visit.
* *[.underline]##C##lose*: exit from the *_OPD Out Patient Department_* function.

Furthermore, a search function (*[.underline]##S##earch*) is available using the *Selection panel* on the left side of the window.

==== 3.2.1 Search Patient Visits ([.underline]##S##earch)

Queries about ambulatory patient visits can be done using the search criteria available on the *Selection panel* area of the window (on the left side of the window).

The following fields are available to select or narrow the resulting matches:

* *Disease type*: Select a specific disease type or all disease types
* *Disease*: select a specific disease, or all diseases, or searching for partial matches by typing some letters in the search field
* *Date*: “Date From” and “Date To” to select all visits occurring during the specified period
* *Age*: “Age From” and “Age To” to select patients by age
* *Sex*: Select patients by sex: All / Male / Female
* *Type of patient*: Select visits by type of attendance: All / New / Re-Attendance

After specifying the selection criteria, press the *[.underline]##S##earch* button.
The counter at the bottom of the window indicates how many visits match the specified criteria
and the individual visit data is shown in the *Data table* area.

The example below shows all the visits for patients with _asthma_ disease admitted in the period from 29-5-2020 until
5-6-2021; all ages, all sexes, and all patient types are included.

image:image10.png[OPD Visits,width=810,height=337]

[#create-a-new-patient-visit]
==== 3.2.2 Create a New Patient Visit ([.underline]##N##ew)

Press the *[.underline]##N##ew* button in the *_OPD Out Patient Department_* window to access the *_New OPD Registration_* window shown below.

image:image11.png[New Patient Visit,width=391,height=435]

To record a visit, enter data into the following fields:

* *Type of attendance*: This field is not meant to distinguish whether an individual is new or not in the ambulatory
(that is, whether this is the absolute first time they have entered the ambulatory). The NEW ATTENDANCE selection
indicates whether the patient comes to the ambulatory to report a new
health issue or new disease for which no care has been previously addressed or recorded. This could be their initial
visit or their n-th time in the ambulatory, it does not matter with regards to this field. If this visit is for an
issue or disease previously addressed the field is not selected and records are created for the patient
with regards to the follow-up care and instructions for recovery.
 +
 +
_Example: A patient comes to the ambulatory because they report a cut; this event is recorded as
NEW ATTENDANCE and the doctor sutures the wound and invites the patient to come back ten days later; when the same patient comes back
after ten days to have his/her stitches removed, a new OPD record is then created but without the NEW ATTENDANCE flag set._
 +
* *Admittance Date*: The date on which the patient is seen for the recorded activity.
* *Disease Type*: By selecting a _Disease Type_, the first diagnosis list will contain only related diseases.
The second and third list continues to contain all diseases.
 +

NOTE: Disease Types are defined by the Administrator. Ask the Administrator or check the
<<settings,Settings>> chapter._

* *Diagnosis*: A maximum of three diseases can be diagnosed per each attendance (“new attendance” or “re-attendance” does not matter in this context). Normally the patient reports at least one visit reason but it may happen that
during the same visit the doctor finds other concurrent pathologies thus it is possible to record
up to  a maximum of three (the first being the only one mandatory) diagnoses. +
It is possible to use filters to find diseases more easily.
To do so, enter a text fragment in the search field that is part of the disease name.
The closer the search text comes to the name of the disease being searched, the more precise the search is.
 +
 +
_Example: In the *OPD Out Patient Department* window only the first diagnosis and its type are shown,
but all the corresponding data is stored and available in reports and for searching._
 +
* *Age*: The patient's age; the valid age range is 0-200.
* *Sex*: The patient's sex; either male or female.

When finished entering data, the *Buttons panel* has the following choices:

* *[.underline]##O##K*: confirm and record the patient's visit.
* *[.underline]##C##ancel*: close the window and return to the *_OPD Out Patient Department_* window.

==== 3.2.3 Modify a Recorded Patient Visit ([.underline]##E##dit)

In order to modify a visit, first highlight it in the *_OPD Out Patient Department_* window. Once highlighted,
press the *[.underline]##E##dit* button. When the *_Edit OPD Registration_* window is shown, all the data can be changed or modified.

image:image12.png[Edit Patient Visit,width=373,height=414]

Once the data have been inserted, the *Buttons panel* shows the following choices:

* *[.underline]##O##K*: confirm new values (all the previous values will be lost).
* *[.underline]##C##ancel*: close the window and return to the *_OPD Out Patient Department_* window without applying any changes.

==== 3.2.4 Delete a Recorded Patient Visit ([.underline]##D##elete)

In order to delete a visit, first highlight it in the *_OPD Out Patient Department_* window.
Once highlighted, press the *[.underline]##D##elete* button. The highlighted record is shown in a
confirmation dialog: now the record can be deleted. Deleted records are no longer available.

image:image13.png[Delete Patient Visit,width=278,height=206]

The *Buttons panel* shows the following choices:

* *[.underline]##Y##es*: confirm the deletion of the visit.
* *[.underline]##N##o*: close the window and return to the *_OPD Out Patient Department_* window without deleting the visit.

=== 3.3 OPD Extended

The OPD functionality can be extended by changing the _OPDEXTENDED_ flag in the configuration file. Ask the Administrator or refer to the _Administrator’s Guide_ .

==== 3.3.1 Additional Features

Press the *[.underline]##N##ew* button in the *_OPD Out Patient Department_* window to access the 
*_New OPD Registration_* window shown below.

image:image14.png[OPD Edit Extended,width=1024,height=771]

The OPD Extended module affords the following additional features:

* Calendar to choose the visit date (1);
* the OPD number now is visible (2): it is the progressive number per year automatically set by the system, changes to the value can be made only at the first registration in a year, then it will be increased automatically at each registration. The OPD number *MUST* be unique for each year.
* Registered Patient (3): before choosing a disease, first select a patient from the drop-down list (this is *required*); to find a patient use the search field nearby by typing part of the patient's name or code; this improves the reliability of reports and statistics, and therefore is a service to the patient by knowing his/her history.
* Once the patient is selected and a previous OPD visit is found, special fields are populated with the most recent visit of the patient (4), his/her personal data (5), and the Re-Attendance checkbox will be selected automatically upon selection of the main (first) disease (6);
* It is now possible to set the next appointment date (7). This automatically schedules a visit visible in *_Therapy Management_*.
* if a new attendance for this patient is required set the "New Admittance" check box and proceed normally.
* If editing an old OPD it is possible to change everything except the patient, which the OPD refers to, and the "New Admittance" check box.
* In the case the selected patient personal data need to be updated, it is possible to click on the Edit icon image:image15.png[Edit icon,width=26,height=26] near his/her name; a new window shows the patient personal information ready for modification.
* In the case the patient is not yet registered, the *_<new patient>_* entry can be selected to register a new patient; after registration, the program returns to the OPD window and the new patient is selected.
* If the user is enabled by the Administrator (see <<users-groups,Users & Groups>>) the following is shown:
** the *Examination* button function (see <<patient-examination,Patient examination>>)
** the *Operation* tab after the patient's tab (5) to record small surgeries and other interventions (see
<<operations,Operations>>) as well as in Admission (see <<insert-or-modify-surgery-data,Insert or Modify Surgery Data>>).

[#pharmaceutical-stock]
=== 4.2 Pharmaceutical Stock (Pharmaceutical [.underline]##S##tock)

==== 4.2.1 Main Characteristics

The Pharmaceutical Stock feature is used to store and trace every stock movement that has been made. Every movement is identified by the following data:

* date of the movement
* type of the movement, that is, if it is a charging or discharging one
* the ward that the movement refers to. This feature is needed for discharging movements only. It is important to know in which ward pharmaceuticals have been used, otherwise, this field is empty
* the quantity
* the pharmaceutical (which in turn relates to different categories: Laboratory, Surgery, Drugs or Chemical)
* the lot to which the movement is referred to. Some pharmaceuticals may not have a lot related (for example ‘Gloves’), so the field can be omitted. It is recommended to store even the lot (if it exists) because every lot has its own peculiarity:
** a name (that can be its code)
** a preparation date
** a due date
+
In this way, which movement that refers to the pharmaceuticals expiring can be found, or pharmaceuticals prepared on a specific date, or how many movements have been registered about that lot, and so on.
* the supplier of the pharmaceutical. This characteristic is needed for charging movements only. This field is empty in other cases.

==== 4.2.2 Functions of Pharmaceuticals Stock 

To access the functions of Pharmaceuticals, press *Pharmaceutical [.underline]##S##tock* in the Pharmacy menu shown below.

image:image22.png[Pharmacy Menu,width=220,height=182]

The *_Stock Movement Browser_* window shown below is opened.

image:image23.png[Stock Movement Browser,width=598,height=327]

The following functions are available from the *Buttons panel* of the window *_Stock Movement Browser_*:

* *C[.underline]##h##arge*: record a new charge movement.
* *[.underline]##D##ischarge*: record a new discharge movement.
* *[.underline]##E##xport to Excel*: export pharmaceuticals stock movements.
* *Stoc[.underline]##k##Card*: show the history of movement for a certain pharmaceutical (can be directly selected by the list otherwise will be requested).
* *Stock [.underline]##L##edger*: show the history of movement for all pharmaceuticals within a selected date range.
* *[.underline]##C##lose*: exit the *_Stock Movement Browser_* window.

NOTE: There is no “Delete” button as movements cannot be deleted. If a mistake does occur, for example, the wrong quantity of a pharmaceutical is inserted in charge then use a new opposite movement to correct the mistake.  In this example use a discharge movement to undo the unwanted change.

Furthermore, a search function (*[.underline]##F##ilter)* is available using the *Selection panel* on the left of the window.

===== 4.2.2.1 Search Pharmaceuticals Stock Movements ([.underline]##F##ilter)

image:image24.png[Stock Movements Filter,width=169,height=507]

Using the *_Stock Movement Browser_* search function, the information in the window can be filtered to show:

* how many boxes of pharmaceutical remains in the stock
* which movements have been made on a specific day
* in which ward a specific pharmaceutical has been discharged
* if there are any pharmaceutical expired

Queries about movements of pharmaceuticals can be done using the search criteria available on the *Selection panel* area of the *_Stock Movement Browser_* window (left side of the browser). The search results are shown in the *Data table* area.

The *Selection panel* is used to select a group of movements according to specific filters. The filter is set using the tools contained in the *Selection panel*.

Filters refer to three different objects: the *Pharmaceutical*, the *Movement*, and the *Lot Preparation and Lot Due Date*.

For a *Pharmaceutical*, choose either its:

* *_Description_*, the pharmaceutical's name
* *_Type_*: Laboratory, Surgery, Chemical, and Drugs, etc.

To avoid conflicting filters, only one of the options is available at any one time. So, when the description combo box is active, the other one is not, and vice versa.

To quickly find a medical simply type a keyword that is a part of the medical's name into the text field at the top of the pharmaceuticals products combo box and
press the search button (image:image81.png[Search icon,width=15,height=15]) that follows this text field.

For a *Movement*, choose either its:

* *_Type_*: specifies if it is a charge or a discharge type. If the discharge option is selected, then the ward combo box is enabled. The ward combo box allows finding any discharging movements that refer to a specific ward.
* *_Date_*: specifies the data range for the search, between the ‘Date From’ and ‘Date To’ values. The date tools consist of three blank areas, which (from left to right) refer to day, month and year. As a value is inserted into a blank area, moving to the next area is accomplished by using the “Tab” key on the keyboard. When the window is shown the date range is set to the previous week by default.

Finally, for *Lot Preparation Date* and *Lot Due Date* movements that refer to specific lots can be found by inserting:

* the _lot preparation date_: a valid time span (between ‘Preparation Date From’ and ‘Preparation Date To’)
* the _due date_; behaves similar to the lot preparation tool and the movement date tool

Each filter can be combined with another, allowing for many possibilities.

After the filtering criteria are chosen, press the *[.underline]##F##ilter* button and the matching data is shown in the *Data table* area.

===== 4.2.2.2 Insert Stock Charging Movement ([.underline]##C##harge)

To insert charging movements, press *[.underline]##C##harge* in the *_Stock Movement Browser_* window. The *_Stock Movement_* window is shown:

image:image25.png[Stock Movement Charging]

It is possible to perform more than one charging movement at a time. The window is composed of two areas: a *Panel* and a *Grid*.

The *Panel* contains the following fields:

* *Date*: the date of the movement
* *Charge Type*: the charge type
* *Supplier*: the origin of the pharmaceutical
* *Reference No.*: the reference of the operation

The *Grid* is filled with the pharmaceuticals involved in the charging movement. To fill the grid, use the field above the grid to select a pharmaceutical. Enter into the field the code or the description of the pharmaceutical to move, and
press *ENTER.* This will open the *_Choose a Medical_* window.

image:image26.png[Medical Selection]

Select the desired medical and click *[.underline]##Y##es*. This will open a new window where the quantity of the medical is specified:

image:image27.png[Input Quantity,width=310,height=135]

Then press *[.underline]##O##K*. If there is an existing lot in the system, the *_Existing Lot_* window is shown:

image:image28.png[Existing Lots]

If stock movement is related to this existing lot, select it and click *Selected Lot*. Otherwise, click *New Lot* and the *_Lot Information_* window is shown with the following fields:

* *Lot No.*: The lot code
* *Lot preparation*: The lot preparation date
* *Expiring*: The lot expiring date

image:image29.png[Lot Information]

Enter the appropriate values and then press the *[.underline]##O##K* button. The *_Input_* window is shown, where the unit cost is specified:

image:image30.png[UnitCost Input]

Then click *[.underline]##O##K* to insert the medical information as a line in the grid.

Finally, click the *[.underline]##S##ave* button to save the charge movement.

NOTE: The Lot definition can be set as automatic by changing the AUTOMATICLOT_IN flag in the configuration
file, so every new charging movement automatically creates a new lot. Regardless of the setting,
the Expiring Date must always be provided. Ask the Administrator or refer to the _Administrator’s Guide_.

NOTE: In order to avoid managing the cost of medicals set the LOTWITHCOST flag to _no_ in the configuration file. Ask the Administrator or refer to the _Administrator’s Guide_.

[#insert-stock-discharging-movement]
===== 4.2.2.3 Insert Stock Discharging Movement ([.underline]##D##ischarge)

To insert discharging movements, press the *[.underline]##D##ischarge* button in the *_Stock Movement Browser_* window. The *_Stock Movement_* window is shown:

image:image31.png[Stock Movement Discharging]

It is possible to perform more than one discharging movement at a time. The window is composed of two areas: a *Panel* and a *Grid.*

The *Panel* contains the following fields:

* *Date*: the date of the movement

Different than the *Pharmaceuticals [.underline]##S##tock* functionality, the *Pharmaceutical Stock [.underline]##W##ard* allows only discharging movement to patients since it is an internal management of pharmaceuticals held in the ward after they have been “charged” by the main pharmacy. It is also possible that the discharging movement from ward to ward can be accomplished.

The *_Ward Pharmacy_* window shows a *Filter panel* on the left, a *Movements panel* in the right-center, and a *Button panel* at the bottom.

===== 4.3.2.1 Rectify ([.underline]##R##ectify)

It is possible to rectify the quantity held in stock in the Ward Pharmacy. This may be necessary when a drug is damaged or stolen. To do this,

* *Patient* or *Internal use* or *Another Ward*: a registered patient can be selected by clicking on the *[.underline]##P##ick Patient* button so the movement is associated with his/her ID or select *Internal use* and type a description to specify that the movement is not related to a patient. Selecting *Another Ward* allows for choosing the destination ward from the list provided.
* *Medical*: first select the drug to give to that patient (the only ones that are in the ward as a result of a previous discharging movement in the *_Pharmaceutical Stock Browser_*) from the dropdown list and then press the *[.underline]##M##edical* button. It is possible to specify the quantity (multiple and half-piece are allowed) in the window shown:

image:image41.png[WardPharmacy Quantity,width=231,height=139]

If _AUTOMATICLOTWARD_TOWARD_ has been enabled the user will be requested to select a lot (similar to
<<#insert-stock-discharging-movement,Insert Stock Discharging Movement>>).

NOTE: The lot selection can be enabled or disabled (set as automatic) by changing the flag AUTOMATICLOTWARD_TOWARD in
the configuration file, so every new discharging movement will automatically select a suitable lot for the
operation according to the expiring date (FEFO). If the first selected lot does not contain enough quantity
to serve the discharging movement, several discharging movements may be generated if the quantity laying in
other lots can satisfy the request. Ask the Administrator or check the _Administrator’s Guide_ for more information.

Before pressing the *[.underline]##O##K* button, insert as many Medicals as needed, it will show a corresponding number of movements in the *Outcomes* tab of the *Movement panel* in the *_Ward Pharmacy_* window.

== 6 Accounting (A[.underline]##c##counting)

=== 6.1 Main Characteristics

Accounting is the function that is used to manage the billing process where bills for pharmaceuticals, operations, exams, and other costs of a patient are created and managed. Currently, the billing process is not linked with other functions of *Open Hospital* and therefore the application does not generate the accompanying billing information based on the therapy followed by the patient: [.underline]#the billing information must be input for all items manually.#

In addition, the accounting function supports the management of bill payments (total or partial) and the generation of reports.

.Press the *A[.underline]##c##counting* button or “Alt + C” to open the Accounting submenu
